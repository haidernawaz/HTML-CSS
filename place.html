          </figure>
          <p>The Pyramids of Giza are Cairo's number one half-day trip and the top thing to do on everyone's itinerary.</p>
          <p>The Pyramid of Cheops (also called the Great Pyramid or Pyramid of Khufu) is the largest
             pyramid of the Giza group, and its interior of narrow passages can be explored, although 
             there isn't much to see, except a plain tomb chamber with an empty sarcophagus.</p>
             <p>Farther south on the plateau is the Pyramid of Chephren (also known as the Pyramid of Khefre), with an internal tunnel 
                area, which can be entered, and the smaller Pyramid of Mycerinus (Pyramid of Menkaure). Guarding these mortuary 
                temples is the lion-bodied and pharaoh-faced Sphinx; one of the ancient world's iconic monuments.</p>

              <h2>2. The Egyptian Museum</h2>
              <figure>
                <img src="/graphics/place_the_egyptian_museum.jpg" alt="The Egyptian Museum">
              </figure>
              <p>When opened, it will be the biggest museum in the world devoted to exhibiting the antiquities of a 
                single civilization, displaying a wealth of Ancient Egypt's artifacts, many of which have never been seen by the 
                public before.</p>
                <p>The Solar Boat (one of the ceremonial solar barques that was unearthed near the Giza Pyramids), which used to be 
                    displayed in a museum directly behind the Great Pyramid, has recently been moved to the GEM in readiness for the opening.</p>
                <p>After a stop-start construction, beset with financial difficulties, the museum opening date has been set for late 2022.
                    The pyramid plateau is on the edge of Giza's suburban sprawl, roughly 13 kilometers southwest of the central city.</p>
                <p>Address: Al-Ahram Street, Giza</p>

              <h2>3.Al Azhar Mosque</h2>
              <figure>
                  <img src="/graphics/place_al_azhar_mosque.jpg" alt="Al Azhar Mosque">
              </figure>
              <p>Al-Azhar Mosque is the finest building of Cairo's Fatimid era and one of the city's earliest surviving mosques, completed in 
                972 CE.</p>
                <p>It's also one of the world's oldest universities - Caliph El-Aziz bestowed it with the status of university in 
                    988 CE (the other university vying for "oldest" status is in Fes) and today, Al-Azhar University is still the 
                    leading theological center of the Islamic world.</p>
                <p>The main entrance is the Gate of the Barbers on the northwest side of the building, adjoining the neo-Arab facade built by Abbas II.

                    Leave your shoes at the entrance and walk into the central courtyard. To your right is the El-Taibarsiya Medrese which has a mihrab (prayer niche) dating from 1309.</p>
                <p>Al-Azhar Street runs east from Midan Ataba in the downtown area right to the square where the mosque sits.</p>
                <p>Address: Al-Azhar Street, Historic Cairo District</p>

                <img src="/graphics/place_khan_el_khalili.jpg" alt="Khan El Khalili">
            </figure>
            <p>Founded in the 14th century, the Khan el-Khalili is one of the most iconic places to visit in Cairo. There is a 
                labyrinth of alleyways that interconnect to form a lively bazaar. Here, you get to experience medieval Cairo,
                 and as such, the cultural and financial importance of this market is undeniable.</p>
            <p>Visit the tiny shops to purchase authentic Egyptian products. It is also the perfect place to pick up some 
                souvenirs like silverware, incense, ancient Pharaoh, etc. Don’t forget to taste the delicacies of the El-Fishawy 
                café or the El-lord café. If you are lucky, you can also witness the Sufi celebrations with litany performances 
                and carnivals. </p>
            <p>Location: Off Al-Azhar Street, Islamic Cairo District</p>
