  <h2>Culture</h2>
  <p>Egypt is cosmopolitan as it is the perfect fusion of so many cultures. The culture and tradition of Egypt is like a melting
     pot where multiple cultures and traditions have created a wonderful picture and a mentality that embraces new and advanced 
     ideas for creating a liberal ambiance around. This liberal attitude is being displayed in Egyptians friendly behavior toward 
     foreigners and tourists. If asked, people of Egypt will always share their service and enthusiasm with the people whom hardly 
     they know. In Egypt, besides its marvelous attractions and cultural ambiance, the smiling faces of the Egyptians are an added 
     charm. All these sweet fragments are the best part of the visit to Egypt, which will remain with you as a memory forever. 
     Commonly, Egyptians are quite adjustable in nature and they love to help people. If you ask them any question, they will 
     answer it happily.</p>

  <h2>FAMILY</h2>
  <p>In Egypt, family integrity matters a lot and head of the family takes the entire responsibility to run the family in proper
     manner and with great focus on behavior. People put special respect for family value and family relation. Perhaps this is one 
     of the reasons that traveling in the cities of Egypt is safer than any other top global destinations, even for women traveling 
     alone.</p>
<h2>FOLK MUSIC INSTRUMENT</h2>
     <p>The ancient Egyptians were known for their love of music and their appeal at every level private and public life, used 
      in the breeding of the optimum, and in celebrations, feasts, services of the temple, the farewell of the dead, and so on 
      The inscriptions of the battles of victory from the pictures of the soldiers of the musicians playing drums They blow into 
      horns. The Egyptians were not satisfied with what was accompanied by concerts and official holidays of music, They created 
      opportunities for banqueting, which friends are invited for food and drink to hear and sing. Many also liked playing 
      instruments and singing. Archaeological research in Egypt and other countries of the East in the last hundred and fifty 
      years has provided us with many valuable documents on the importance of the progress of the East in its civilization and 
      the influence of Egypt on other civilizations, including Greece. The popular musical instruments are: string instruments:
       Harp, Sesame, Oud, Kanon, Al Rababah and other string instruments. As well as aerodynamic instruments, rhythmic instruments, 
       including the Drum, the Darbuka, and other rhythmic instruments.</p>
