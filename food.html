  <p>Cairo, the capital city of Egypt, is primarily famous for historical sightseeing. But it 
    offers a lot more than that. If you are a foodie, you are surely in for a treat as Cairo has 
    some of the best foods in the world. You will be amazed by the flavour and variety of authentic 
    dishes. The food is rich in fats and carbs, and there are many sorts of meat to choose from. 
    If you are vegetarian, don't worry because many dishes use a lot of vegetables. In addition, 
    you can find North African and Middle Eastern influences in their cuisine.</p>

    <p>Koshary is a national dish and one of Cairo's most famous street foods. It has a base of 
      rice and macaroni and is mixed with lentils or chickpeas. Vinegar and tomato sauce are added 
      to it. It is then garnished with fried onions. It is a simple traditional food that is considered 
      to be vegan heaven. Koshary is related to Mediterranean cuisine, but the dish here uses local lemon
       sauce, which gives it a different and unique taste.  </p>
