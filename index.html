 <h2>HISTORY OF CARIO</h2>
 <p>Cairo has always been associated with the ancient city of Memphis which history goes back 5,000 
  years. Memphis is 24 km southwest of Cairo, very close is the Giza pyramid complex that holds the 
  only remaining one out of the world’s ancient seven wonders the Great pyramid of Khufu. The early 
  traces of Egypt can be traced to the Romans 2000 years back when they took over Egypt and 
  constructed a fortress called Babylon which was the center of the orthodox community during the Coptic era 
  in the late 4th century. The true history of the city started in 641 BC when Amr ibn Al-as conquered Egypt and 
  constructed the new Islamic capital of Egypt Al-Fustat north from the ancient fortress of Babylon.  From this point on, a 
  series of spectacular immortal constructions took place in the city like the mosque of Ahmed Ibn Tulane in 878 BC.
 <br>
 <br>
 In 970, during the rule of the Fatimid dynasty, a general by the name of Jawhar established a new city called Al Qahirah (Cairo) 
 northeast of the current settlements and in that dynasty which became the official capital of Egypt along with the magical Khan el
  Khalili Bazaar after the destruction of the city of Fustat by flames in 1168 during a battle against the crusaders. During the 
  11th century, Egypt became under the rule of Salah El-din who transformed the city into an imperial metropolis and constructed 
  the powerful Cairo citadel. In 1340, Cairo officially became the biggest city in Africa, Asia Minor, and Europe plus a center of
   the Spice trade. Al-Azhar university became the center of Islamic studies which were constructed to be one of Cairo’s greatest architectural masterpieces at the hands of the Mamluk dynasty.</p>
    
   <h2>PEOPLE OF CAIRO</h2>
  <p>Cairo's historic center was awarded World Heritage Site in 1979. The city of Cairo has a population of over 9 million spread 
    over 453 km2 (175 sq mi) and it is by far the largest city in Egypt. Cairo is a city found in Egypt part of the African 
    continent in the shape of a fan, narrowest in the south, where the river valley is found flowing between desert escarpments, 
    and widest in the north, where the valley blends into the delta. Across history, Cairo expanded westward, as a receding river
     channel left land flood-free.</p>
